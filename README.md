# Motivation

When I started [sledge](https://github.com/telent/sledge) I wrote

and then largely failed to come up with a half-decent protocol for
querying the available media.  Phonograph is an experiment to answer
the question "what if that protocol exists already and it is SPARQL?"

Status: pre-pre-pre-alpha verging on vapourware
